| ifconfig      | Displays the configuration of all active network interfaces on the system including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and more. | ![carbon (2)](https://github.com/gunduzl/Network-Commands/assets/69585166/4fc12585-2e2f-4c44-a916-367c1bbde1ad) |
| ip            | The ip command is a more comprehensive and modern alternative to ifconfig for network configuration and management in Unix-like systems. It offers extensive functionality including address management, routing, device manipulation, policy routing, and tunnel configuration.  | ![carbon (3)](https://github.com/gunduzl/Network-Commands/assets/69585166/1a8f179a-6f40-4608-bc56-dad6734833ba) |
| ping          | Tests connectivity between two hosts by sending ICMP echo requests and waiting for ICMP echo replies. | ![carbon (4)](https://github.com/gunduzl/Network-Commands/assets/69585166/f22106c1-7967-4901-acfa-f5116b478bcc) |
| traceroute    | Displays the route that packets take to reach a destination by sending packets with increasing TTL values and analyzing the responses. | ![carbon (5)](https://github.com/gunduzl/Network-Commands/assets/69585166/ffcd4094-c86b-4e11-b56f-127c6d19e7bb) |
| netstat       | Displays various network-related information such as active network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, etc. | ![carbon (6)](https://github.com/gunduzl/Network-Commands/assets/69585166/92c0b4ff-28c0-45d2-a428-1d53d187fa36) |

| dig           | Another DNS lookup utility that provides more detailed information about DNS records and server responses. | ![carbon (9)](https://github.com/gunduzl/Network-Commands/assets/69585166/db725470-22be-4f90-8e88-0f5c9081f98c) |
| hostname      | Displays or sets the hostname of the system.             | ![carbon (10)](https://github.com/gunduzl/Network-Commands/assets/69585166/b91a1358-0700-466d-9418-a2a7f65e5146) |
| route         | Displays or modifies the IP routing table, including adding or deleting routes.  It allows users to add, delete, or modify routes in the routing table, which determines how network packets are forwarded to their destinations. | ![carbon(11)](https://github.com/gunduzl/Network-Commands/assets/69585166/99dcc440-8165-4cc7-907c-fbbdec43192e) |

| iptables      | A powerful firewall utility for configuring packet filtering, NAT, and other network-related rules. In macOS, the equivalent of iptables in Linux is the pfctl command, which interacts with the Packet Filter firewall, also known as PF. PF is a versatile firewall included with macOS that allows you to define rules for packet filtering, NAT (Network Address Translation), and more. | ![carbon (2)](https://github.com/gunduzl/Network-Commands/assets/69585166/eb10a1d6-b244-4bee-9904-2ebc71a47031) |
